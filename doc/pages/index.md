# Neko Manual {#index}

Neko is a portable framework for high-order spectral element flow simulations.
Written in modern Fortran, Neko adopts an object-oriented approach, allowing
multi-tier abstractions of the solver stack and facilitating various hardware
backends ranging from general-purpose processors, CUDA and HIP enabled
accelerators to SX-Aurora vector processors. Neko has its roots in the spectral
element code Nek5000 from UChicago/ANL, from where many of the namings, code
structure and numerical methods are adopted.

Neko is currently maintained and developed at KTH Royal Institute of
Technology.

  !> Explicit extrapolation scheme for time integration.
  !! @details
  !! Compute the value at the current time-step by evaluating a polynomial
  !! built using the values on previous time-steps.
  !!
  !! For a constant time-step corresponds to the following schemes of order
  !! 1 to 3:
  !! - Order 1: \f$  u^{n+1} = u^n \f$
  !! - Order 2: \f$  u^{n+1} = 2u^n - u^{n-1} \f$, linear extrapolation
  !! - Order 3: \f$  u^{n+1} = 3u^n - 3u^{n-1} + u^{n-2} \f$
  !! An additional scheme is available via `compute_modified_coeffs`, which is
  !! gives improved stability when combined with BDF2 in a advection-diffusion
  !! equation.
  !! - Order 3: \f$  u^{n+1} = 8/3u^n - 7/3u^{n-1} + 2/3u^{n-2} \f$

## Simulation of the three-dimensional Taylor--Green vortex (TGV)

In this case we simulate a 3D Taylor--Green vortex in a cubical box of size $2\pi$ in each direction. During the simulation, the total kinetic energy and enstrophy are computed. The resulting flow fields may be visualised using Paraview or VisIt by opening the field0.nek5000 file.

There are three different meshes provided, $8^3$, $32^3$ and $64^3$ elements. New meshes could be constructed using a suitable Nek5000 box file, using appropriate conversion.

## About
This example illustrates how to set up and execute simulation cases in
Neko from C via Neko's C API. The interface defines a simulation case
as a JSON object enabling easy integration in contemporary computing
environments.

### Installation

To use the C API a JSON library is needed, in the provided example the
Jansson C library is used.

## Tollmien-Schlichting (TS) wave test in channel flow.
The temporal instability of TS wave in a channel flow at Re_c=5000 is tested in this example.
A 2D (k_z=0) TS wave and two 3D (k_z=\pm 1) oblique TS waves are settled up as the initial condition in a channel with 1 period on streamwise and spanwise direction.

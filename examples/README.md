# Example cases 

# Prime tutorial examples
More documentation and more effort is spent to make sure these cases work. Illsutrates the general workflow and features of Neko.
- turb_channel, collect statistics and analyze them for a low-Re turbulent channel flow
- cylinder, Collect statitsics with one homogenous direction and compute the lift and drag around a cylinder at $Re_D=200$. The time series can also be used to compute the Strouhal number.
- TS_channel, subcritical transition due to interaction between two low-amplitude TS-waves.

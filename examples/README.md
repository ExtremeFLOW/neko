# Example cases

# Prime tutorial examples
More documentation and more effort is spent to make sure these cases work.
Illustrates the general workflow and features of Neko.
- turb_channel, Collect statistics and analyze them for a low-Re turbulent
  channel flow
- cylinder, Collect statistics with one homogenous direction and compute the
  lift and drag around a cylinder at $Re_D=200$. The time series can also be
  used to compute the Strouhal number.
- TS_channel, Subcritical transition due to interaction between two
  low-amplitude TS-waves.
- programming, A collection of programming tutorials designed to teach the
  basics of Neko code necessary to write user files.

## L1 (108×18×36) — σ=0 CDI diagnostic, COMPLETED and postprocessed

ε=0.053, R=0.4, γ=0.05. Restart from `fluid00004.chkp` (t=20→25). 128 ranks, 1 node.

| Case | Run name | Job | Status | κ_rms plateau | Postprocessed |
|------|----------|-----|--------|---------------|---------------|
| σ=0 ε=0.053 | `channel_p2_sigma0_eps053` | 19003682 | COMPLETED t=20→25 | ~56 (t≈22) | ✓ time-series, snapshots |
| σ=0 ε=0.09 | `channel_p2_sigma0` | 19003683 | COMPLETED t=20→25 | ~50 (t≈22) | ✓ time-series only |

**Note on L1 We cases:** Early We=10 and We=1 runs (`channel_p2_we10`, `channel_p2_we1`,
jobs 19003684–19003685) were submitted 2026-03-28 but are considered stale:
`channel_p2_we1` blew up immediately at t≈20.22 (capillary instability, same as baseline
mesh); `channel_p2_we10` was killed at t≈22.3. These runs are de-prioritised — the
canonical We cases will be run at L2/L3 once the CDI kink artifact is resolved.

## L2 (144×24×48) — σ=0 CDI diagnostic, COMPLETED and postprocessed

ε=0.04, R=0.4, γ=0.05. Restart from `fluid00004.chkp` (t=20→25). 256 ranks, 2 nodes.

Note: `channel_p3_sigma0_p2` was cancelled after diagnosing the _p2 extra GS as a no-op
(see σ=0 diagnosis section below).

## L4 (288×48×96) — planned, not yet started

ε=0.02, R=0.4, γ=0.05. 1,327,104 elements, ε/Δxz=0.458, ε/Δ_GLL=3.2, R/ε=20.
Factor 3/2 from L3 (the 4/3 progression gives nz=85.3, non-integer, so 3/2 used instead).
Estimated ~14 nodes / 1792 ranks.

Workflow (when ready):
1. Generate mesh on egidius: `genmeshbox 0 12.5664 -1.0 1.0 0 4.1888 288 48 96 .true. .false. .true.`
2. Write spin-up case file and job script (follow L3 pattern)
3. Run spin-up, validate turbulence
4. Submit σ=0 case; defer We cases until CDI kink is resolved

| Case | Run name | Job | Status |
|------|----------|-----|--------|
| Single-phase spin-up | `channel_l4_single_phase` | — | NOT STARTED |
| σ=0 | `channel_l4_sigma0` | — | NOT STARTED |
| We=10 | `channel_l4_we10` | — | NOT SUBMITTED — awaiting CDI fix |
| We=1 | `channel_l4_we1` | — | NOT SUBMITTED — awaiting CDI fix |

## σ=0 CDI diagnostic — findings

σ=0 cases use CDI only (no surface tension). κ_rms measures the curvature residual
from the SEM discretisation. Expected reference value: κ_sphere = 2/R = 5.

### Non-dimensional CDI parameter

The non-dimensional compression parameter is Γ* = γ/u_max. With γ=0.05 and
u_max≈1.38 (instantaneous domain maximum from ekin.csv): **Γ* ≈ 0.036** across
all mesh levels (same γ, same flow). This is less than 1, meaning CDI compression
is ~27× slower than the peak local velocity. The interface is maintained because
the CDI acts on the interface thickness scale ε, not the bulk scale — but Γ*
sets the margin. It is the same value for L1, L2, L3 since γ is not rescaled
with ε in the current setup.

### κ_rms convergence results

| Mesh | ε | κ_rms plateau | κ_rms/(2/R) | Plateau reached | Notes |
|------|---|---------------|-------------|-----------------|-------|
| L1 (ε=0.09) | 0.09 | ~50 | ~10× | t≈22 | Large ε, informative only |
| L1 (ε=0.053) | 0.053 | ~56 | ~11.2× | t≈22 | Convergence series point |
| L2 (ε=0.04) | 0.040 | ~54–56 | ~10.8–11.2× | t≈23 | Slight late-time creep |
| L3 (ε=0.03) | 0.030 | ~67–68 | ~13.4–13.6× | t≈24 | Late-time creep similar to L2 |

**Key finding:** κ_rms does NOT decrease with mesh refinement at constant ε/Δxz.
L3 (finer mesh) reaches a HIGHER plateau than L2. Both L2 and L3 show slow upward
creep after the plateau — consistent with turbulence gradually deforming the interface
and increasing kink amplitude in dynamic equilibrium.

### Kink root cause

The artifact is **intra-element**, not inter-element. After GS(∇φ)+normalize, n̂ at
shared face nodes is already identical between elements — so the extra GS on n̂ (the
_p2 "fix") is a no-op: it sums identical values and divides back.

The actual kink is in the Lagrange polynomial connecting the averaged face-node n̂ to
the element-local first-interior n̂. The SEM endpoint derivative amplification
D[N,N]≈14 (N=7) amplifies this jump. Since the kink curvature scales as ~1/Δx ∝ 1/ε
at constant ε/Δx, **mesh refinement at constant ε/Δxz makes κ_rms worse, not better**.

CDI convergence in the literature refers to interface shape accuracy (φ), not the
computed curvature via div(n̂). The SEM derivative amplification means div(n̂)-based
κ will not converge to κ_sphere regardless of mesh refinement without a different
curvature scheme (height-function, parabolic fit, or pre-smoothed n̂).

### Potential fixes (not yet implemented)

- Repeated GS on ∇φ before normalisation — propagates the face average inward one
  node-ring per pass (requires multiple passes per time step)
- Helmholtz-type smoother on n̂ — filters the intra-element kink
- Fundamentally different curvature scheme — height-function or parabolic fit

### Next step (planned)

The normal field n̂ is used in both CDI (compression term) and CSF (surface tension
force). The working hypothesis is that n̂ quality is the root cause of the κ_rms
artifact — and will also drive spurious currents once We>0 cases are run. The next
plan is a dedicated normal-field study, continuing with σ=0 (We=0) to avoid blow-up
from spurious currents while isolating the normal-field behaviour. This will involve
directly analysing n̂ computed from the φ snapshots (recomputable via SEM derivative
operators), visualising the face-node vs first-interior jump, and evaluating candidate
smoothing strategies before enabling surface tension.
